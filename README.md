# REACTICON 2021 DEMO


Hi

If you are wondering, what this project is about, then let me explain.

I had the honour to be a speaker at this years REACTICON (www.reacticon.org).
My talk was about "Rock-Solid CI/CD pipelines for Shopware" and this project is the demo project that I showed during that talk.

It is a simple Shopware 6 Google Recaptcha plugin for the registration form.
Event though that already exists in Shopware 6, I thought it might be a good thing, because it has all kinds of things in PHP as well as Javascript.

The code might not be perfect, but it was more about the pipelines anyway.


Also, I tried to automate CSS animations from within the pipeline in www.buddy.works 
So if you do find any rain or sun animations...just ignore them, they are were just a joke ;)


have fun
